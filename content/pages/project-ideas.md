I will keep this page updated with details of project ideas as they strike, and 
_I do get quite a stream of them._ Regardless of how irrational some of these 
ideas may seem, I'll have them here anyways. You might be able to run off with 
them and possibly make them better. 

Where I find that I have the requisite bandwidth, and resolve to do so, I would 
go ahead to work on an idea.

- Can we have a way to integrate IOT with **existing cars**? I reckon that, 
since we can't all afford to purchase Teslas and all the other modern brands of 
luxury cars, it would be nice to see some automobile IOT integrations in the 
form of _plug and play_ addons to existing models. 
For context, an example is something that prevents my car door from opening 
when the side mirror or some other sensor detects and approaching vehicle or 
bike, which is sometimes a cause of fatal accidents.


- A database of words to foster translation of text across languages. 
Essentially, I'd like the creation of tools that can aid in the preservation of 
of Nigerian languages and their features.


- A wiki for the purpose of tracking developments over time on news items that 
require this.


- A web-scraping based Python library that provides a public API that wraps 
Nigerian newspapers websites.


- An online classroom (mostly text only) for programming classes, where 
facilitators can hold sessions with students who care to attend. All participants 
would be able to communicate via the same interface. Like [](), participants 
would be able to run live code from within their digital client (browsers, 
apps...). This is quite similar to what we have with [DgpLUG summer training on 
the IRC platform]().


- A _marketplace_ where merchants can own their own sub-domain (stores) as part 
of the general platform (Think of how you own your own custom 
[Slack](https://slack.com) space and domain name). They'd be able to customize 
the look of their space, list their offerings, and more. Essentially, it would 
be a platform that mimics the real life scenario of a market. It would also 
lower the entry for digital commerce, by reducing the need for merchants to get 
fully bespoke digital market spaces.


- Digital receipts. A way to store receipts digitally have them accessible 
anytime, from anywhere. With a reliable cloud storage, receipts can live longer, 
and can even be transferred from one person to another as the ownership of a 
commodity or service changes in some cases.
