<p>I'm Tosin Animashaun, a Nigerian, and in here is where I document stuff as I go. </p>

I currently [contribute](http://ng.linkedin.com/in/acetakwas) to the 
technical efforts at <a href="http://www.techadvance.ng/">TechAdvance</a>, 
a software development outfit out of Nigeria, that has got her feet in the 
<a href=http://www.gpayafrica.com/>payments</a> and 
<a href="http://www.bus.com.ng/">transportation</a> spaces, as well as in the 
digitisation of government services.

Alongside a group of friends, I was previously involved with something of a 
quasi-entrepreneurship experience, where we ran a small a group called 
<a href="http://krohx.github.io/">Krohx</a>, but never really got any of our 
creations to the market. _Sadly_. Even though this group is now defunct, this 
was, for us, a great learning adventure.

I have also somewhat unofficially interned with 
<a href="http://niitlagos.com/">NIIT</a>, where, as ad-hoc instructor, I helped 
facilitate classroom sessions in Jave SE, Microsoft SQL Server, the .NET framework 
among other duties.

Outside my paid professional engagements, I spend some of my ever tight 
schedule helping out at the [Python Users Nigeria Group](http://pythonnigeria.org), 
as the community continues in her drive to push the frontiers of digital development 
in Nigeria, being backed by the global [Python community](https://www.python.org/). 
I was her pioneer Secretary from 2016 through 2018. I have also assisted with the 
organising of every [PyCon Nigeria](https://twitter.com/pyconnigeria) event so far, 
often helping with media coordination.

A fond pastime of mine is listening to podcasts on subjects including the 
English language, technology and psychology. I also like to read well written 
content just as I occasionally try my hands at crafting good stuff myself.

In short, a lot of my non-work time is spent 
<a href="http://tosinmash.com/article/wholesome-learning.html">garnering more 
general knowledge</a>, as I regard this as fueling for my autodidact persona.

I am not all bookie, as I love good music and art too!


Being an autodidact, I do not possess a college degree -- I do not 
completely believe in its sole efficacy -- as I have so far pulled out of two 
endeavours to obtain at least one.
