<p>I'm Tosin Animashaun, a Nigerian, and in here is where I document 
stuff as I go. </p>

<p>I currently contribute to the technical efforts at 
<a href="http://www.techadvance.ng/">TechAdvance</a>, a software development outfit out of 
Nigeria, that has got her feet in the <a href=http://www.gpayafrica.com/>payments</a> and 
<a href="http://www.bus.com.ng/">transportation</a> spaces, as well as in the 
digitisation of government services.</p>

<p>I have previously delved into entrepreneurship with a group of 
friends at <a href="http://krohx.github.io/">Krohx</a>, but I am currently on hiatus 
from this. I have also somewhat unofficially interned with 
<a href="http://niitlagos.com/">NIIT</a>.</p>

<p>Aside from my <a href="http://ng.linkedin.com/in/acetakwas">day job as a backend developer</a>, 
I spend a lot of my non-work time <a href="http://tosinmash.com/article/wholesome-learning.html">garnering more 
general knowledge</a> as fueling for my autodidact persona. I like to 
read well written content, and I occasionally try my hands at crafting 
good stuff like I am doing with this space.

Some other interests of mine include music, art, and psychology.
</p>

<p>I am also an avid podcast listener. My listening areas of interest 
include: technology, psychology and history among others.

</p>

<p>Being an autodidact, I do not possess a college degree -- I do not 
completely believe in its efficacy -- as I have so far failed at two 
attempts to obtain at least one.</p>
