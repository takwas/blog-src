Summary: A VERY PRECISE SUMMARY ABOUT THIS ARTICLE




If you have ever struggled with understanding a concept, and you have read 
frustratingly extensively, with no luck, as yet, to wrapping your head around the 
subject, this little trick might prove useful.

The subject of Unicode has been one long, mind boggling concept for me over the 
years. I have read and re-read just about the same set of articles to try to nip 
this topic in the bud, all with no breakthrough. In my most recent attempt, I'd 
like to think to think that I made some progress.

Prior to starting to read, I drew out an array of blanks. Essentially, I marked 
out a number of buzzwords and catch phrases of relevance, and placed big query 
marks after them.

The goal? To be sure I had understood what these meant by the end of the 
reading session. The other side-effect was that it made me look out for those 
same XXXs with intent.

Metaphorically, this is akin to embarking on a journey with no clear direction, 
and marking out milestones/landmarks as they are reached.
