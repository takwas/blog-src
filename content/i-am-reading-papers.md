Summary: One of my plans for 2016 is to expose myself to academic papers.




If I had a resolution for the new year, it would be my plan to read one academic paper per day. I feel as though reading people's documented research work would help broaden my knowledge and deepen my insight.

So I started looking for a way to crowdsource paper suggestions from a source, namely [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-recommended-list-of-essays-papers-to-read-one-per-day-in-2016-for-an-autodidact-who-wants-to-widen-his-horizon?share=1). However, as I didn't get the much needed feedback in due time, [Google](http://google.com/) was my next stop. My google search led me to [this page on Github](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love)

After launching the first paper in my document-reader software, I was surprised to see that my earlier projections of papers being under 20 pages was flawed, and so I decided to replan the whole paper-reading thing.

Therefore, I will now attempt to read at least one paper per week.

The reasons for this are not far fetched. I don't want to consume these publications like some fictional works. Instead, I want to read to near-full if not full understanding of their content.

The paper I am currently reading, my first, is "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures" by __Roy Thomas Fielding__. It was his submission for a doctoral program in the year 2000.
