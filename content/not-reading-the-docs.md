Summary: Make it a point of duty to peruse documentation.




It is a well known fact within our circles that one of the quickest ways to get 
started with any *piece of technology* is to get started using it. This has 
been proven time and again to be an effective method for kicking off with 
programming tools.


The downside to the above approach is that, if the learner fails to follow up 
their early success with some studying of the documentation that was created to 
enrich the knowledge gained, they would have very limited understanding and 
would likely abuse the technology, not mentioning the myriad of times they 
would be needlessly stuck with making progress with the technology.


Reading documentation has a lot of advantages, some of which are immediately 
apparent. These include versatility with that technology the documentation is 
about, clarity of areas that might have seemed hazy to the learner, best 
practice information as well as something else like it: knowing the right 
(recommended) way to do a thing with the technology.

There are more benefits that await one when the effort is made to peruse the 
documentation backing some technology. One can better teach a technology or 
even make a public presentation on it, for instance.


Most times, the documentation is written by the author of the project. 
Based on this, it is safe to say that the author pours out their heart into the 
writing, often better communicating their design decisions. I have previously 
quoted [Armin Ronacher](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/about/) on the importance of 
gleaning design decision [here](/readying-for-net-help.html#armin_quote).


> The book knowledge cannot be overemphasized.

Programmers need to have this factful statement ingrained as they go on in 
their *creative* journey.
